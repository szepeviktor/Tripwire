# Tripwire

A PHP script, designed to be run by a cron job, which detects files which have been added, deleted or modified since the previous execution of the script. **Sends emails** with a summary of changes. Great for detecting malicious activity (hacking, unauthorised access other hacker actions).


## Uses

Wordpress virus guard. I have seen a virus which will rewrite your php files [documented here](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/virus-appending-base64-code-to-all-php-files).

Malicious Uploads. This script will tell you *anytime* a file is added/removed/modified. This can get annoying, but between the settings available in Tripwire, and your own email filters, you should be able to come up with a nice solution.


## Installation

Download this repo as a zip and install on your server, or use a `git pull`.

### In terminal, run:

```bash
cd ~

git clone https://github.com/polyesterhat/Tripwire.git tripwire

cd tripwire

git submodule init && git submodule update

cp tripwire_config.sample.ini tripwire_config.ini
```

That last command will make an untracked config file (which is good). Now, configure the `tripwire_config.ini` file ([ini file info here](http://us3.php.net/parse_ini_file)). At least put in your own email address and customize the paths array so the script knows which directories to watch.

### Set up the Crontab (cronjob)

```bash
crontab -e
```

This will open a VI editor. And paste in: 

```
*/15 * * * *  /usr/bin/php /path/to/Tripwire/tripwire.php
```

If you don't know how to use `vi`, just remember, hit the `i` key to start typing or pasting, and then hit `Esc` and `Ctrl + ;` to enter command mode, and once in command mode type `wq` and hit `Enter`. This will save and exit.

15 is the number of minutes tripwire should wait, if you want 5, put a 5 instead of a 15. [More information here](http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man5/crontab.5.php).
